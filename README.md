# Miami-University-Sexual-Climate-Survey-Results-Analysis
 Sexual violence is of growing concern among college campuses in the United States. Miami University is no exception. Preventing and remedying sexual misconduct is essential to ensuring a safe environment in which students can learn.    To obtain information about the prevalence of sexual assault and interpersonal violence a climate survey was initiated and administered. Respondents were undergraduate and graduate students at Miami University. 

The statistical techniques used in this project will hopefully provide results to form a conclusion on the key facts about sexual violence in relation to various demographic characteristics of students at Miami University.

Additionally, we  weighted the responses in relation to the demographic characteristics of the University population and make inferences about the issue of sexual violence.

Summary descriptive statistics, data visualizations, contingency tables and some form of weighted estimates to make inferences about the demography of the population and sexual violence. Future research can use regression or anova models to explain the incidence of number of sexual violence as well as the factors that affect this.   We  look at using contingency tables to describe as much as possible the incidence of interest analysis might be conducted to see a difference amongst the incident descriptors.
